The Little Engine That Could

A long train filled with toys and goodies for children was stuck on a mountain. The big engines refused to help, but a small engine, despite its size, agreed to try. "I think I can, I think I can," it puffed as it struggled up the hill.

The little engine faced many challenges, the steep incline, the heavy load, and its own doubts. But it never gave up, repeating its mantra with every chug. "I think I can, I think I can."

Finally, with one last burst of effort, the little engine reached the top of the mountain. "I thought I could, I thought I could!" it cheered, delivering the toys and goodies to the waiting children.
